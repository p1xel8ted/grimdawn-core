/**
 * The things a consumer reaches for first: where the game and its saves are, and
 * what a parsed character is.
 *
 * Everything else is a subpath — `@grimdawn/core/save/gdc`,
 * `@grimdawn/core/db`, `@grimdawn/core/icons`, and so on. This barrel is
 * deliberately thin: re-exporting the whole library from one specifier would
 * drag the `.arz` reader and the DDS decoder into a consumer that only wanted to
 * know a save's path.
