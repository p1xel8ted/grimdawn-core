/**
 * Turning saved item instances into something a human (or a model) can read.
 *
 * A save stores an item as record paths plus a seed — `baseName` names the base
 * item, `prefixName`/`suffixName` name the rolled affixes, `relicName` the fitted
 * component, `augmentName` the applied augment. Every display name, stat and icon
 * comes from the game database keyed on those paths.
 *
 * By default this does not re-roll the seed: every number is the record's own,
 * which is the middle of the range rather than the roll on this copy. Pass
 * `rolls` and each saved instance also carries `rolled`, the seed replay of its
 * base and affix resistances, for a caller that wants the figures the game
 * actually gave this item. Nothing else changes, and a caller that does not ask
 * sees exactly what it saw before.
