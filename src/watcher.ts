/**
 * Watch the save tree and say, in domain terms, what the game just wrote.
 *
 * The point is not "a file changed" — that is one `fs.watch` call — it is
 * **"a file changed and is readable"**. Grim Dawn writes saves event-driven and
 * non-atomically, so a read that races the write sees a torn file; the block
 * checksums catch that immediately, which is exactly the retry design Stage 1
 * built, now driven by a filesystem event instead of a keypress. A watcher that
 * announced the raw event would hand the window a save it cannot parse and turn
 * every autosave into an error banner.
 *
 * So each event is debounced (the game writes several files in a burst), then
 * parsed, retried a few times a second apart, and only then announced — with the
 * parsed save attached, because the consumer would otherwise immediately read the
 * same file a second time and could lose the race the retries just won.
 *
 * **No `chokidar`.** The stage plan called for it; the repo's zero-runtime-
 * dependency rule wins, as it did for `sharp`, `execa`, `react-markdown` and
 * `lucide-react`. `fs.watch(dir, { recursive: true })` is FSEvents on macOS and
 * ReadDirectoryChangesW on Windows — the two platforms this tool runs on — and
 * everything chokidar adds on top of it (globbing, stat polling, atomic-write
 * heuristics) is either unnecessary here or is the debounce-and-parse loop below,
 * which has to exist either way because a `.gdc` is only valid when its checksums
 * say so.
 *
 * Plain Node, zero Electron: the CLI `watch` command drives the same object the
 * main process does, so this is verifiable without a window.
